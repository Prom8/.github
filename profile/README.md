## About The Project

There are many ways to learn coding, but sometimes information found is not co-related to what a person is specifically looking for

Here's why:

* Everyone has different installation packs and learning machines
* Lack of understanding of issue
* have a very specific error or problem you can't find via search engine or any other platform :sad:

Obviously this project will not cover all there is to cover, but we will do our best to bring solutions to even some of the things we have faced and had to go through hours on end to find a solution to.
